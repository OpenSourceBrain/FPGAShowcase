FPGA based neuronal simulations
-------------------------------

For more details see: http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/fpgashowcase

The main purpose of this OSB project is to compile a list of FPGA based simulation initiatives, linking to downloadable code & publications. See here for more: http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/fpgashowcase/wiki/Wiki

This GitHub repository is intended for code snippets and examples which can be run on some of the featured platforms.

There is already a [simple NeuroML2 network](https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/FPGAShowcase/tree/master/NeuroML2) which could serve as the basis for examples to run on different platforms.
