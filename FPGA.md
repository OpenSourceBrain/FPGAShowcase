### Background

â€¦

### Bluehive project

### Si Elegans project

### BrainFrame Project

The goal of the BrainFrame effort is creating a back-end hardware library of designs emulating the Cerebellum system, based on reconfigurable (DFEs in this case) platforms, 
as a practical simulation solution for real-time neuro-scientific experiments. Eventually also make a library of generic constructs that can used on general neuron model 
development (focused mostly around biophysically-meaningful modeling). This backend will be combined with a PyNN front-end to implement  the BrainFrame tool-flow. PyNN, a Python-based, simulator-independent language for 
specification of brain models, is a widely known and used framework by computational neuroscientists. PyNN is capable of achieving high-speed simulation and
it already offers a common interface to popular simulation platforms such as NEURON and NEST
as well as newly developing ones that show great future potetial, such as NeuroML.
